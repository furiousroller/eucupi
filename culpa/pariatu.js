// Assuming there is an HTML element with the ID "mainCanvas"
<canvas id="mainCanvas"></canvas>

// JavaScript code to access and manipulate the canvas element
const canvas = document.getElementById("mainCanvas");
// Now you can use the `canvas` variable to interact with the canvas element, for example:
canvas.width = 800; // Set the width of the canvas
canvas.height = 600; // Set the height of the canvas
